/***************************************Exercise: Managing a Bakery's Daily Orders*****************************************/
############################################################################################################################
    You're tasked with creating a simple program to help a bakery manage its daily orders using
    vectors.
############################################################################################################################
Requirements:
1. Vector Definition and Initialization:
    ○ Create an empty vector to represent today's orders.
    ○ Use a fill constructor to create a vector of pre-prepared items.
    ○ Initialize a vector with a customer's order using braced initialization.
    ○ Copy the customer's order into the main order list.
2. Accessing elements:
    ○ Print the first, last, and third orders using appropriate vector functions.
3. Modifying the vector:
    ○ Add new orders to the end of the list.
    ○ Find and remove a specific order.
    ○ Insert pre-prepared items at the beginning of the order list.
    ○ Add a large catering order, resizing the vector if necessary.
    ○ Optimize the vector's storage after completing some orders.
4. Vector Size Operations:
    ○ Print the current size, capacity, and maximum possible size of the vector.
5. Max and Min Elements:
    ○ (Optional) Find and print the least and most complex items in the order list,
    assuming you have a way to compare their complexity.

6. Iterators:   
    ○ Iterate through the orders using normal, reverse, const, and auto iterators.
7. Clearing the vector:
    ○ Clear all orders at the end of the day.
    ○ Check if the vector is empty.

Remember:
    ● Use appropriate vector functions for each requirement.
    ● Comment your code to explain the purpose of each step.
    ● Test your program with different scenarios to ensure it works correctly.
    Challenge:
    ● Can you add error handling to your program, such as checking if an order exists before
    trying to remove it?
    ● Can you implement a way to track the status of each order (e.g., "pending," "in
    progress," "completed")?
